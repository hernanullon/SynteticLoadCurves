# SynteticLoadCurves
 The daily load profile modeling is important for the economic operation and stability analysis of the distribution networks.   A flow-based generative network is proposed to model daily load profiles of the distribution network. Power loads in different regions are also modeled by adjusting the structure and parameters.  The real samples are used to train a series of reversible functions that map the probability distribution of real samples to the prior distribution. The new daily load profiles are generated by taking the random number obeying the Gaussian distribution as the input data of these reversible functions.
